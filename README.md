# REA-Malware
Use these viruses at your own risk, better yet, in a VM. I am 100% not responsible for any damage.

Other Notes: don't send this to anybody randomly and change the filename. If someone is talking about REA and how it infected their computer, tell them about the repository. If the virus is a ransomware, the decrypter is in it's folder with the ransom. 

Recomendations: Use a VM with No network and no USB devices connected. Use Windows 11, as these are where the files are developed. It is reccomended that you use MacOS for testing, as it runs on the Unix platform.
